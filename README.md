 - Assume your application will go into production...
	 - What would be your approach to ensuring the application is ready for production
		(testing)? security and peformance
	
	 - How would you ensure a smooth user experience as 1000â€™s of users start using your app simultaneously?  doing stress test and performance test
	 - What key steps would you take to ensure application security? in real world i will check the sql injection if we use sql and pick secure cloud server.
	 - What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about ? Were you short on time and not able to include something that you want us to know about? 
		 - more security
		 - more complex handling condition
		 - more connection validation
		 - more connection establish
	 - this technical challenge is interesting to me. i have learn more about websocket from this test
